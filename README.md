## Installation on a new machine
1. Open a terminal and navigate to `/home` with `cd ~`. 
2. Clone this repository by running `git clone git@github.com:leungjch/dotfiles.git`. 
3. Navigate into the directory by running `cd .dotfiles`. 
4. For every directory here, run `stow [directory]`. Install stow if it is not already installed. This will create symlinked files for all the configuration files in the `/home` directory.
5. Your configs are sync'd up!
